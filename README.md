# Java Chess Engine

This is a two-player chess engine implemented in Java, featuring move validation, checkmate detection, and a structured object-oriented design. The project aims to simulate a playable chess game with rule enforcement and piece interactions.

## Features
- Fully functional chessboard with all standard chess rules.
- Move validation for each piece (king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn).
- Check and checkmate detection.
- Basic user interface (GUI using Java Swing).

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Concepts Used:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Algorithms, Game Logic

## How It Works
The game uses an 8Ã—8 board representation, where each piece is an object.
Move validation follows standard chess rules.
The engine checks for checkmate and prevents illegal moves.

## Future Improvements
Improving the graphical user interface (GUI).
Adding AI to allow single-player mode against a computer opponent.
Keep track of the players' movements and display them in the GUI.
